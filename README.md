# Football Player Comparison and Recommendation Web App

Welcome to the Football Player Comparison and Recommendation Web App! This project leverages the power of machine learning, GPT-3.5, Flask, Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Plotly to provide an interactive platform for comparing and analyzing football players.

## Features

- **Player Comparison**: Enter the names of two football players, and the web app generates bar charts and radar charts showcasing key attributes for a comprehensive visual comparison.

- **Player Recommendation**: Discover players with similar profiles to your inputs using cosine similarity, allowing you to explore alternative options.

- **Analysis Paragraph Generation**: Dive deeper into player comparisons with automatically generated analysis paragraphs written by GPT-3.5, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each player.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset through a Jupyter notebook that showcases how players were clustered using KMeans and Agglomerative models. Learn about the data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and tuning process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.

- **Flask**: A micro web framework that powers the interactive user interface.

- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for managing and processing the football player dataset.

- **scikit-learn**: Used for building the KMeans and Agglomerative clustering models to cluster players with similar styles and calculate cosine similarity for player recommendations.

- **Plotly**: Provides the tools to create interactive and visually appealing bar charts and radar charts for player attribute comparison.

- **GPT-3.5**: Integrates the capabilities of the GPT-3.5 language model for generating insightful analysis paragraphs.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Launch the Flask app by running `python app.py`.

4. Access the web app through your preferred web browser.

5. Enter the names of two football players you want to compare and analyze.

6. Explore the generated charts for attribute comparison and player recommendations.

7. Read the analysis paragraphs to gain deeper insights into player comparisons.
